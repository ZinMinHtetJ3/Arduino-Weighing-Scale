# Arduino-Weighing-Scale
Arduino Weighing Scale Using Load Cells

## Here is the *Material List* to make this project:
  - Arduino Nano
  - HX711 24-bit ADC Amplifier
  - 2 * 20kg load cells
  - 16 x 2 LCD
  - mini breadboard
  - 2 x 220 Ohm resistors
  - some jumpers

## Steps to make this project:
  1.  Make the circuit like the one in diagram
  2.  Upload the **Calibration.ino** file to the board and calibrate with the instruction shown in the file
  3.  Upload the **HX711.ino file** and test weighing
  4.  Finally, upload the **final_code.ino** file and start using the scale.
